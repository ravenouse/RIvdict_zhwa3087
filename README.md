This repo is to describe our experiments and store our codes to proceed with the Reverse Dictionary Task, which
is one of the two tracks of [SemEval 2022 Task 1](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34022).<br>

In the [evaluation phrase of this task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34022), our generalized model ranks about #6 in multiple tasks of multiple languages among all the recognized participants.<br>

In the [post_evaluation phrase of this task](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34022#results), our specialized model ranks about #3 or #4 in multiple tasks of multiple languages among all the recognized participants. <br>

Our codes along with a formal paper will be released on March 1st 2022. <br>
