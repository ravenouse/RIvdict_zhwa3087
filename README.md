# Revdict_1Cademy

## General

This repo is to describe our experiments and store our codes to proceed with the Reverse Dictionary Task, which
is one of the two tracks of [SemEval 2022 Task 1](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/34022).<br>

Our Paper has been submitted to the SemEval2022 on Feb 28th 2022. The link to the current version of our paper: [Zhwa3087 at Semeval-2022 Task 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g8975sB83w-Q4EUkH3uPUnjPswCA10vp/view?usp=sharing).<br>

All our models' codes are adapted from and inspired by [organizers' baseline code](https://github.com/TimotheeMickus/codwoe/tree/main/code). <br>
We want to express our thanks to the organizers here again for their effort.<br>
